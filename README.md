# Pac-man-game
This is a classic Pac-Man game we built for our CSE423(Computer Graphics) course project. The game was developed using Python and the OpenGL library. We used the Midpoint line algorithm, Midpoint circle algorithm, and Eight-way symmetry to establish the logic. 


# How to play ▶️
- You are the Pacman in the yellow circle
- Use W,S,A,D to move up,down,left and right
- Eat the orange balls to increase your score
- Beware of ghosts, they will eat you
- Lives and score shows in the top-right corner
- There are 5 levels in the game
- As you go next level so does difficulties increase

# Interface 
There are two themes in the game. Pressing N will change the theme from day to night or vice versa.
